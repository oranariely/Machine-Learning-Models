Hello!

This project consist of one big project of Deap Neural Network Learning classification problem with real raw data and several most commom Machine Learning models,
for each model i had anaylized the data, train and predict the goal variable. 

Model i used are: Linear Regression, Logisitc Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees and Random Forest, SVM, KMeans Clustering

**All the code was writen in jupyer notebook.**
